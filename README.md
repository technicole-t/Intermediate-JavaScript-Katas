# 17 Short JavaScript Katas implemented with Full TDD

This repository was created to practice demonstrating logic to solve and find solutions for short individual JavaScript problems.

It is an NPM project and I have used Mocha and Chai to implement full TDD.

### Learning Resources

I used [Kyle Simpson's Get Started](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/get-started/README.md) book, which is a great intro to JavaScript and gives a thorough overview of the topics needed to complete these katas. Read the [Preface](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/preface.md), all of [Chapter 1](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/get-started/ch1.md) and [Chapter 2](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/2nd-ed/get-started/ch2.md) up until the section on 'Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)'.

Another great resource is Paul Ford's excellent article, [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)

### Regular Expressions

I used [this tutorial](http://regexone.com/) to introduce the key components of Regular Expressions.
