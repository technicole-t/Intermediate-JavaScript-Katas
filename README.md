# Precourse Section 2

These are the last tasks you are expected to complete before you start the course. Please make sure you give us time to review your code ahead of your start date, else we may have to delay it! Don't forget - you're aiming for 200 points on CodeWars too.

## Reading

Take a look at [Kyle Simpson's Up and Going](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going) book, which is a great intro to JavaScript and gives a thorough overview of the things you should understand at this point. Read the [Preface](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/preface.md), all of [Chapter 1](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md) and [Chapter 2](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md) up until the section on 'Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)'.

You may also enjoy reading (or at least beginning!) Paul Ford's excellent article, [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)

It's a long read, but stick with it - it's probably one of the top articles of all time, on any subject. When Ford first published it in Bloomberg Businessweek, the magazine completely sold out and is almost impossible to get hold of in hardcopy now.

## Regular Expressions

Regular expressions are common across all programming languages and allow you to match complex patterns in strings of characters. Have you ever wondered how forms know whether your email address is valid, or how the strength of your password gets rated? These are examples of common problems can be solved with regular expressions.

Work through [this tutorial](http://regexone.com/) to introduce the key components of Regular Expressions.

Finally, play around with writing your own regular expressions in [Regexr](http://regexr.com/). Some matches to try:

- A word with 8+ characters
- A word of 5 characters including at least 1 number at the end
- A sequence of words separated by underscores or hyphens
- A valid .com email address
- A valid .co.uk email address
- A valid mobile phone number beginning in 07
- A date in the format 11-01-2017 OR 11-02-17
- A hashtag or mention e.g. #mondaymotivation, @northcoders

## Functional Programming

How about adding a couple of new tools to your toolbelt? `map` and `filter` are methods available on all arrays (like `slice`, `pop` and `push`) and are extremely useful! 

Map allows us to transform elements in an array, and filter allows us to filter down an array based on elements we want to keep or reject.

Both of these things we can do perfectly well with for loops, but `map` and `filter` make it a lot easier, and arguably make our code easier to read.

Firstly, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=9a10b561-1e8b-405b-a677-73c215d264fb&feature=cards&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84&src_vid=Wl98eZpkp-c&v=BMUiFMZr7vk) on functional programming which explains how to use `filter` and how the same operation could be achieved with a normal for loop.

Then watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCqtb-Z5YGQ&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84&index=2) which demonstrates the use of the native map method, another classic example of functional programming.

## Challenges

The steps for completing the final challenges in Section 2 are the same as Section 1. Use what you've learnt about regex and functional programming where you can, but if you can't make it work, feel free to send us a message on Slack or come along to a drop-in session. Any feeback you received on the previous section should be applied to your solutions. When you're finished, <a href='https://us-central1-precourse-pushes.cloudfunctions.net/reviewme/?section=PRE-2' target='_blank'> request a review.</a>
